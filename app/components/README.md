# Components Folder

This folder contains reusable React components used throughout the app.

- Components here are UI building blocks like buttons, headers, cards, forms, etc.
- Organize components by feature or functionality for maintainability.
- Components should be kept presentational and stateless whenever possible.
- Can include subfolders for grouped components.

Example:

components/
Button.js
Header.js
CompetitionCard.js
